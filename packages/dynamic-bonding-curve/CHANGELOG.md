#### Breaking Changes

- IDL includes `creatorWithdrawSurplus` and `claimCreatorTradingFee` instructions.
- Partner, Migration, Creator, Pool and State functions are now called in this manner:
    - `client.partners.createConfig` -> `client.partner.createConfig`
    - `client.migrations.migrateToDammV1` -> `client.migration.migrateToDammV1`
    - `client.creators.createPoolMetadata` -> `client.creator.createPoolMetadata`
    - `client.pools.swap` -> `client.pool.swap`
    - `client.getProgram().getPoolConfig` -> `client.state.getPoolConfig`
- In order to get the DBC Pool Address, or DAMM V1 Pool Address, or DAMM V2 Pool Address, use the following functions (the order matters):
    - `deriveDbcPoolAddress`
    - `deriveDammV1PoolAddress`
    - `deriveDammV2PoolAddress`
